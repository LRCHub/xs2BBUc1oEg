Washington, D.C. is pretty but
it ain't my city
I need a town where I can get
down
I follow traces of faces of
people baby
And when they get it on the
world turns brown
In my town you can walk around
at night
Go anywhere with anyone you like
Don't like to leave I'd rather
hang around
I love it 'cause the world comes
to my town
C...A...RA...MEL
The younger you feel the more it
feels right
Crossover genes in the middle of
the night
I thought a little color hurt no
one
But I was wrong baby, dead wrong
So I'm calling all white people,
black people
Asians, South Asians, Hispanics,
Natives everybody
I'm gonna scream it at the top
of my lungs
Caramel city is where I come
from
C...A...RA...MEL
It don't get better when you run
and hide
I like to see it when the worlds
collide
I wanna do it baby, do it like
we do every night
I'm sick and tired of just being
friends
I want to melt in pots and make
amends
The first kiss means the party
is about to begin
Washington, D.C. is pretty but
it ain't my city
I need a town where I can get
down
I follow traces of faces of
people baby
I need love from everyone around
So I'm calling all white people,
black people,
Asians, South Asians, Hispanics,
Natives everybody
I'm gonna scream it at the top
of my lungs
Caramel city is where I come
from
C...A...RA...MEL
C...A...RA...MEL
C...A...RA...MEL
